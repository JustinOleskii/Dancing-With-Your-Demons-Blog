Everyday of our existence is about making ourselves happy.
Sounds selfish doesn't it? Unfortunately, it is the truth. Every day that we live, no matter how kind or generous you are, at the end of the day, it's your happiness that matters the most.

But sometimes, there's this aching pain in your heart. A dull, throbbing paain that bring you to tears everytime you think of the someone or something causing it.

Everyone has been hurt. You cannot be reading this post if you haven't experienced some kind of emotional pain before.

It hurts. _I get that._

How you handle the pain? **That** is the real question. 
Maybe you'd like to take the backseat on life, as you ruminate over the things that have happened in the ppast instead of letting it go and moving forward?

_Don't._ It's unhealthy. It only adds to your stress, it adds to the pain, and hurts your ability to focus on anything, be it your studying, working, or chatting it up with your friends.

Blaming others for our pain is what we commonly do. I'm guilty of it, and so are you. We want them to repent for the action against us, but in most cases, nursing your grievances will hurt you more than it hurts them.

Enough talk. Here's what I think are the steps you need to take to let go of the past.

### MAKING THE DECISION
Every great event that has sent ripples through the very fabric of the universe, has started with a decision. A choice. 
A conscious decision, that it is time to let go.

### FEEL THE PAIN
To let something go, you first need to express the hurt stuck inside of you through some medium. Different people have different ways of releasing their frustration. Maybe you rant about your problems to a friend, or you write it down on a piece of paper and burn the paper afterwards to symbolise letting the hurt go.
Doing this will help you understand exactly what your hurt is about.

### FORGIVE
It's time to forgive. You are presented with a choice You can either go forward thinking everyone cares about your feelings, and not forgiving the other person for hurting you is going to result in a great triumph on your part.
**WRONG.**
Fact is, most of the world doesn't give a damn about your feelings. 
The truth is, the best course forward is to forgive. Admit to yourself, _"yes, that person hurt me, but it was a long time ago. If that is what they truly feel about me, let them have their opinions. It's my happiness that comes first." _

### LIVE IN THE PRESENT
Now that you've forgiven them, it's time to stop thinking about the past.
What's done is done, and nothing you do now, and no matter how much you ponder over the same incident, nothing will change.

Instead, live  in the present. Enjoy what's right in front of you. Let it cover up what's happened in the past.
A good friend once explained to me that filling my head with negative thoughts will not help me see any light. It starts within, with a conscious effort to replace those negative thoughts with positive ones that let the light shine through.

None of this will come easy. Sometimes it might feel easier to just live with the pain. If you've held on to the pain for long enough, you might just find comfort in it.

Do yourself a favour, let it go. Let bygones be bygones.

Carpe Diem.
