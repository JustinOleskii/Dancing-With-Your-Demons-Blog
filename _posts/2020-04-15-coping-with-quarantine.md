It's a trying time for people all around as the COVID-19 outbreak spreads. The governments of the world are doing their best to control the spread of this pandemic with the little information they have about this virus. 

More than a third of the world's population is under some form of restrictions, with countries like India, China, France, New Zealand, Poland and the UK implementing the world's largest and most restrictive quarantined ever seen. 

This outbreak is quite stressful for people, triggering fears and anxiety which cause overwhelming emotions in both adults, and children. In addition to the stress, being under quarantine can really take a toll on your mental health. The isolation brought about by the Quarantine leaves you feeling out of control. Time seems to slow down as you spend the hours confined to your homes. Slowly, but surely, cabin fever settles in. 

The American Psychological Association reports that social isolation can lead to poor sleep, lower immunity, depressive symptoms, difficulty remembering things, or managing your emotions et al. 

So, with all the doom and gloom floating, it's important to develop healthy coping mechanisms. Here are some things researchers suggest that can help mitigate the adverse effect on mental health during this quarantine season. 

### ESTABLISH A ROUTINE
Yes. I know. 
"BOOO! I WANT TO SLEEP ALL DAY AND STAY UP ALL NIGHT WATCHING NETFLIX."
Scat. The disruption in your normal routine can leave you feeling aimless - and hence you may feel inclined to spend considerable amounts of your time in bed.
Being a student, for the past 3 weeks, I have completely broken any kind of routine I had. I operate during European work hours and sleep during Indian ones. UNHEALTHY! 
Try to create a schedule that works for you, but only use it as a general outline to give your day some structure. Don't condemn yourself if you can't stick to it.

### STAY CONNECTED
Technology has advanced so much recently. Entire companies are working from home, kids are attending school classes from the comfort of their home. So, why not keep in touch with your friends and family via social media to dampen that feeling of isolation.

### TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF
Basically, don't be me. 
Eat well and on time. Get a good night's rest. Get some exercise done. 
But if you can't, I'm proud of you for just getting out of bed in these trying times. It's daunting.

### JUST ONE DAY AT A TIME
I know it seems like there's a long way to go, but remember why you're doing this. Take every day one at a time as it comes. You are not alone and there are people around the world in the same boat as you. 

Stay safe, stay home.
