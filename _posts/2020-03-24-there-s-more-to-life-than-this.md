Deviating from my ussual writings on topics directly related to mental health issues, I wanted to talk about something different this time. The thought arose one day while I was speaking to a friend.

What's the thought, you ask? Well, here it is.

Is this how you're meant to live?
Are you living life the way you are **MEANT** to live?

Time flies. It's a fact. Nothing can stop the onslaught of time, no matter what you believe. As time passes by, so does your life.  
While you're busy reacting to one problem after the other, seasons change, years fly by, and before you know it, it's time to meet your maker.

Life has a way of pulling you into this monotonous routine. Day in, day out, doing the same thing.
10 years. 20 years. 30 years.  

Obviously, this wouldn't even be a problem if we were mere animals, living life without a buzzing mind to question, "Is this really all there is to life? Is it really meant to be so boring?"  
While you may not ever remember hearing this voice, or maybe you've manage to drown it out with the sound of monotony, there will come a day in the latter part of your life, wherein you are burdened with regret for the life you could have lived, but didn't.  

Only because you didn't question, *"Is this the life I am meant to live?"*

> "Remember this. The world wants to assign you a role. And once you accept that role, you're doomed." ~ Robert Greene  

You've accepted the role society has given you. Everything you do revolves around society and what is acceptable and what isn't in it's eyes. 
The eternal question rings out in your head: *What will people say?*  

You've probably been told to "think outside the box" at some point in your life.  
Here, the box is society, and it's expectations and standards. You could live life confined in that box, or you could break out and be truly free.  
To think for yourself.

We're all different. Playing different parts on life's great stage, each with our own entrances and exits.  
The state of society today is such that everyone is measured by the same standard.  
For example,  
_"You must attain 97% in the finals to be considered a good student."_  
What if studying isn't the person's forte?  
What if their joy and skill is found in music? Maybe they're a whiz with computers?  
Making them feel like crap for not scoring higher in the system just breaks their spirit, and more often that not, they end up becoming just another cog in the maching, when they could have been an all new machine in themselves.  

You have a skill. A talent. Find it. Use it.  

It's time to think about what you can behin doing today. Once you've accepted that you've been living at a disadvantage, you can jump back in and seize control. Set a target. A goal. Something to achieve, and work towards. Work towards it for everyday of your life.  
Until at the end, you can look back and reminisce saying,  
*"I have lived a good life."*
