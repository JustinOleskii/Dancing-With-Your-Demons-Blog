subtitle: Why I'm a crazy person

My name is Joash. I'm a 17 year old from India, currently in Junior year of high school. I have an eye for games with _beautiful_ graphics and love to read and write in my spare time. (Write, more than read these days. Quite a wonderful way to get lost in your imagination)

What else could you possible want to know?
Oh yeah, I'm an extremely busy individual, working a job while dragging my education behind me. I code as a hobby when I feel inspred.
I consider myself a mental health advocate, but the jury's still out on that one.
