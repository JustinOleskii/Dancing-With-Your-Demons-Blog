"You're too ugly."
"You're too weird."
"You're too skinny."
"You will never measure up to _____."
"You aren't good enough."

Sound familiar? These are the things the voice in your head constantly tells you during you finest moments.

Got a promotion?
_"Oh, it had been long enough. You're nothing special."_

Met a goal?
_"It was an easy one. No big deal."_

It's the voice inside that tells you continuously, consistently, that you will never do anything remarkable.
It tells you that you have failed, before you even started trying.
For that voice, someone will always be greater. Smarter. Stronger. It will tell you that you're not pretty enough, or skinny enough, or smart enough.

**Do. Not. Listen. To. That. Voice.**

You are enough. Just the way you are. In this exact moment.
Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Don't let YOURSELF tell you otherwise.
You do not need to change to fit someone else's mould to be perfect. You are perfect just the way you are. 
Blind, dumb, skinny, ugly, pretty, fat, or deaf. 
_You are enough._

In your lowest moments, it is hard to remember what you have to offer to the world. It feels like everything is pointless, and you're just an additional burden to an already overpopulated planet.

This is a reminder. You are important to someone. Someone loves you. And there is someone who would be devastated at losing you.

Not everyday will be easy. Most days will feel like an uphill battle. Fighting one wave of anxiety after the other, just to reach the summit. It is hard. 

There is only one way through. One way to cure yourself of this irrational madness that seems so true. 

**Love yourself.**
Love yourself more than you love anyone else. 

All the adoration, dedication and love you have for others. Show some of it to yourself, before you go knocking to help others. It is your birthright to love yourself and accept yourself for who you are.
There is no one else like you out there.

You are one in 7.8 billion. You have a lot of good coming your way. 
Don't let the darkness taint it.

So, for the uninitiated. What does it meant to love yourself? HOW does one love themself?

The first and foremost thing to understand as you take your first steps onto this journey is - and I've said this a couple times before as well, because I cannot stress this enough - you are the most important person in your life. Your happiness counts far greater than anyone else's.
Your entire life depends on how you love, nurture and take care of yourself.

### BE YOUR OWN BEST FRIEND  

Research says that the pace of self conversation inside your head clocks in at about 4000 words per minute.
The question arises, how much of those 4000 words are wasted in hostility towards yourself?
Take a minute to think about how you treat your friends. Then think of the dialogue that goes on in your head.
Do you think if you used that dialogue 24/7, 365 days a week, anyone would want to be friends with you?

You need to be your own best friend. Treat yourself, have fun. LIVE, as you would with your best friend.

### BE KIND TO YOURSELF  
Being completely honest here, I find it hard to accept compliments about my appearance or my abilities. I'm still learning to accept that other's like the things that I do when I like them myself is the hardest part of self love I've faced so far.

Start by giving yourself compliments. Get out of that box of negative thinking, and really look at yourself. Wade through the sea of discomfort that you feel when complimenting yourself, until you feel comfortable doing so.

### FORGIVE YOURSELF  
We are humans. Humans make mistakes. And we keep making them. We're going to keep making them. Sometimes, the mistakes you make may continue to weigh on you for a long time.
The only way to get that weight off your chest is to make amends. Apologise. 
After you apologise for your mistake, forgive yourself for committing it in the first place. If you believe that you are a villain for commiting a mistake, loving yourself is a distant dream.

### ACCEPT YOURSELF  
You are enough in all the things you bring to this world. Every person brings with them an individual skillset, and personality, never seen before.
Accept yourself for who you are, before the world swallows you whole and steals your individuality. To mould you into their own ideas of the ideal person.
Resist. 


_Last but not the least_

### YOU ARE WORTHY  
You are worthy of all the good things in the world. There is nothing out there that you do not deserve.
When you're having the time of your life, say to yourself, "C'est la vie!"
Savor the joy you feel in those moments and know you are worthy of everything.

Self love is a never ending journey, that needs constant effort.
Best of luck.
