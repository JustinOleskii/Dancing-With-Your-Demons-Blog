_To those fighting silent battles, this one's for you._

It's hard.
For every good thing you do, there's the silence that comes after, in which you dance with your demons, plagued with self doubt, anxiety and sadness.

I know the feeling.

Sitting in silence, having to pretend everything is okay, while on the inside everything seems to be burning down to the ground.

It's a scary place to be.

Fighting an unseen battle to heal from something that has caused you so much pain. You have no one to talk about it to, you're just left fighting on your own.

Having to wake up every day, to fight the exact same demons that you've fought for the past many days, weeks, months or even years, with that sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach that tells you that nothing is going to get better. It's all useless.

Maybe. Just maybe. You're fortunate enough to have someone who can you turn to in the midst of your battles, but they will never be able to understand the sheer magnitude of the pain you're going through. Their words will bounce off your ears, feeling scripted and forced. Words are spoken, but there is no common means of understanding.

It feels like all the world around you seems to slowly disappear, as you are left traiping down an empty path, shrouded in darkness. _Struggling_  to find the light.

To you I have to say,
**you are not alone.**

You are not alone in this silent battle with your demons..
Be it depression, anxiety, stress, _ANYTHING._ You are not alone.
You are not the only one fighting to heal from these wounds that you cannot see.
This post, and this blog, is for you, so that you know, that you are not alone in this fight.

_It is okay to not be okay._ 

You will make it through.
