It's a cloudy summer night. Thick clouds cover the skies. You're taking a stroll down a trail in the pitch dark. Your path lit only by the thin beam of a torch.  
The path is lined with trees on either side.  
As you pass under one of the trees, something falls onto you from above. Thin, and rough, you immediately shake it off, thinking it's a snake.  
Your heart rate picks up. You put distance between yourself and the snake. Scared to look, you nervously light up the area with the torch.  
To your relief, it wasn't a snake. _Just an old piece of rope._  

Relief floods through you, as your heart rate slowly decreases and your breathing evens out. You realise your panic was for nothing. A couple of weeks from now you'll be laughing about this incident with your friends.  

Consider this situation in your mind. How would _you_ feel if this happened to you? Wouldn't you feel panicked as well?

Every so often, we feel something that is far from the truth. It might feel entirely real to us, but that's just what it is.  
__A feeling.__  

As humans, everything we do triggers an emotion, be it positive or negative. Some of them stem from something in the past, or it could be something from the present. There is no end to the amount of emotions we experience throughout the day. The trick lies in differentiating between the real, and the fake.  

Just because your friend looked at your in a funny way doesn't mean they don't like anymore, or that they hate you now. They could have just been in a rush, or may have just been having a rough day themselves. The misinterpretation of this feeling as a fact leads you to feel down for the next few days, as dismay weighs down on you.  

The best thing to do when you feel this way is to fact check. Instead of ignoring how you feel, take a while to stop and find the root cause of why you're feeling the way you are. The only way out is to acknowledge that sometimes your feelings may not be accurate.  

It's not easy to acknowledge your emotions are wrong, but sometimes it's far less painnful than living like you're going to drown in your own troubles.
